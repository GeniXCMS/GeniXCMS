Log into your  and go to &lt;b&gt;Template&lt;/b&gt;, press the &lt;b&gt;Customize&lt;/b&gt; button on the right side. Once the Blogger template designer has opened, you&#039;ll see the &lt;b&gt;Background&lt;/b&gt; option on the left - click on it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Now click on the box below the &lt;b&gt;Background image&lt;/b&gt; title and it will open a window from where we can select a default background image. On the upper left side of this window, click &lt;b&gt;Upload Image&lt;/b&gt; and select the image you would like to use from a location on your computer. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that you should use a JPG, GIF, or PNG image that is no more than 300k in size. If your image is too large, then you can use the  image optimizer to make the file smaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. After you&#039;ve uploaded your image, click &#039;Done&#039; and you&#039;ll be taken back to the background menu. Here you will see additional options like: &lt;b&gt;Alignment&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Tile&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Scroll with page&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Alignment&lt;/b&gt;: change the position of the background image to start either horizontal (left, center, right) or vertical (top and bottom);&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tile (Repeat)&lt;/b&gt;: if you want a small background image to fill the page, choose to repeat (tile) horizontally and/or vertically;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scroll with page&lt;/b&gt;: the box is checked by default, this means that the background scroll along with the page contents. If you want the background picture to not move as the page is scrolled and stay exactly where it is, uncheck this box.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. For a background image with plain color in the middle for content, you might want to remove the main and header background. Navigate to &lt;b&gt;Advanced&lt;/b&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;b&gt;Backgrounds&lt;/b&gt; and type the word &lt;b&gt;transparent&lt;/b&gt; inside the &lt;b&gt;Main Background&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Header Background&lt;/b&gt; box:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. If the background is smaller than the content area, we can fix this using CSS. Scroll down and click on the &lt;b&gt;Add CSS&lt;/b&gt; option, then paste this CSS code inside the box:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;body {&lt;br /&gt;background-size: &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;200%&lt;/span&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.body-fauxcolumn-outer .cap-top {&lt;br /&gt;background: none;&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;/blockquote&gt;Note: to change the size of the background, modify the &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;200%&lt;/span&gt; value in red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you&#039;re happy with the results, press the &#039;Apply to blog&#039; button and enjoy the new background for your site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How to Change Background in a Custom Blogger Template&lt;/h3&gt;Sometimes the above options might not appear in some custom Blogger templates if the body.background variable hasn&#039;t been defined. In this case, we will need to access the HTML of the template:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Go to &lt;b&gt;Template&lt;/b&gt;, click the &lt;b&gt;Edit HTML&lt;/b&gt; button and click anywhere inside the code area. Press the CTRL + F keys to open the Blogger search box:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Paste or type the following tag inside the search box and hit Enter to find it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;]]&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/b:skin&amp;gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;3. Immediately before the &lt;span style=&quot;background-color: yellow;&quot;&gt;]]&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/b:skin&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; tag, paste one of the following code snippets:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a large background image:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;body {&lt;br /&gt;background-image: url(&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;IMAGE-URL.png&lt;/span&gt;) !important;&lt;br /&gt;background-repeat: &lt;span style=&quot;color: #6aa84f;&quot;&gt;no-repeat&lt;/span&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;background-position: center top; &lt;br /&gt;background-attachment: fixed;&lt;br /&gt;background-size: &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;100%&lt;/span&gt;; &lt;br /&gt;}&lt;/blockquote&gt;Note: the &lt;span style=&quot;color: #6aa84f;&quot;&gt;no-repeat&lt;/span&gt; value prevents the image from repeating either vertically or  horizontally. Use &lt;span style=&quot;color: #6aa84f;&quot;&gt;background-repeat: repeat-y&lt;/span&gt; if you&#039;d like the image to repeat vertically, or &lt;span style=&quot;color: #6aa84f;&quot;&gt;background-repeat: repeat-x&lt;/span&gt; if you want it to repeat only horizontally. To increase the size of the background, change the &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;100%&lt;/span&gt; value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If using a repeating pattern, add this CSS code instead:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;body {&lt;br /&gt;background-image: url(&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;IMAGE-URL.png&lt;/span&gt;) !important;&lt;br /&gt;background-repeat: repeat;&lt;br /&gt;background-position: center top; &lt;br /&gt;background-attachment: fixed;&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;/blockquote&gt;4. Open a new tab and upload your background image to Blogger or an image hosting site, and copy the URL of your hosted image to your clipboard. If you don&#039;t know how to do it, please take a look at .  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After you copied it, replace the text highlighted in blue from above with your image url.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;style&gt;h4 a { color: #4584BF; } .post-body ul li { list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px; } &lt;/style&gt;5.

By developing a simple service that does one thing, and does it well, Instagram has become one of the most prominent photo sharing apps on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The great thing about using Instagram is that it&#039;s not just for individuals. Businesses and non-profits alike can take advantage of this service to share their day and passions with their dedicated customers and fans.

Adding Instagram on Blogger as a widget also offers an incredibly accessible tool for stock photos to use in new posts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This guide will explain how to add an Instagram widget to your site with step-by-step instructions. The design of your new Instagram widget is entirely customizable and will allow you to modify the background color, font, and how the widget is actually displayed on the site.

Wherever you decide to store your files, this will have an impact on some important aspects like the speed that your site loads, your overall SEO ranking and your ability to make necessary adjustments to the site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Things To Think About&lt;/h3&gt;When you are designing your online structure and where to store your important CSS and JavaScript files, here is a run down on how this decision might impact your site later on:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Site Loading Speed&lt;/h4&gt;By combining some of the style sheets and website files, the Blogger server only has to collect information from a single location. When you split up your files or decentralize the file system, it takes a longer time for all the data to come together to make your site possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slow loading speeds can negatively impact your SEO ratings because the slower the site is, the less likely that visitors are going to wait around for it to load. If someone visits your site and immediately clicks the &#039;back&#039; button because it&#039;s taking too long to load, that is going to increase your bounce rate and provide Google with statistics that show your site is either low quality or irrelevant to the search keywords.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;File Storage Affects SEO&lt;/h4&gt;In addition to increasing your bounce rate, storing your files in a central location and managing the name of your files can affect SEO site wide. Web crawlers enlisted by Google, or some of the other search engines, index both the code on your site, and the name and directory of your files. If file names are random or not placed in the proper categories, the web crawlers aren&#039;t going to know what to do with the information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clear file structure and a central location provide you with incentive to organize everything and name them appropriately. All the content that is relevant to the subject of your website or blog will be in the same location for web crawlers to review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Storage Locations Affect Editing Abilities&lt;/h4&gt;Shuffling through files and folders or opening up FTP connections just to make some simple edits can be a hassle, and take up a lot of time that could have otherwise have been spent writing new content.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#039;re a Blogger site owner, this is something you need to think about. When you need to make alterations to things like social media sharing buttons, popular posts, recent posts and related posts widgets, you have to know where everything is intended to go, or risk losing both available content and money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the larger sites that produce hundreds of unique articles each month can&#039;t afford to have content in different locations. When articles start to get lost out of order, they run the risk of duplicating content on their site, or forgetting to post it altogether. Things should be right at your fingertips to minimize mistakes and reduce the amount of time spent editing the site while it&#039;s still live.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Storing Javascript/CSS Files With Google Drive&lt;/h2&gt;Storing Blogger CSS and JavaScript files with Google Drive will help to eliminate any of the problems mentioned above and reduce the clutter among your services. Taking this method can increase your site speed, increase the opportunities for a successful SEO campaign, and make your life so much easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Google Drive provides ample amount of space to store large files, and offers collaboration services so that you can work among different team members on the same project. Some of the files that you upload into the cloud services can remain unpublished and stay within the private site, whereas other files like blog posts can be published or stored to the public site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another beneficial feature of storing all your Blogger files on Google Drive is that it is highly secure. Google comes with the backing of one of the leading companies in the technical world so that you can be sure your content is safe from hackers and those looking to compromise your site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This guide will provide you with step-by-step instructions on how to setup your Blogger site using Google Drive. It&#039;s completely free to take advantage of this strategy, and will provide you with a solid platform from which to build your blog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;ssmainhide&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Step 1. Prepare the CSS/JavaScript Files&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;First, we need to create the file that we need to host. To host a CSS file, open the Notepad and paste the CSS code (if it is enclosed within the &amp;lt;style&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;/style&amp;gt; tags, remove them).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the Notepad menu, select &#039;File&#039; &amp;gt; &#039;Save as&#039; and type the file name with the &lt;span style=&quot;background-color: yellow;&quot;&gt;.css&lt;/span&gt; extension just like I did with mycssfile.css - see the screenshot below.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the same window, choose &quot;All files&quot; in the &quot;Save as type&quot; option and set the Character Encoding to UTF-8.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you want to host a JavaScript file, add the &lt;span style=&quot;background-color: yellow;&quot;&gt;.js&lt;/span&gt; extension (instead of .css) at the end of your file name (remove the &amp;lt;script&amp;gt;...&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt; tags if you see them). Click &quot;Save&quot; and navigate to the location where you want to save the file.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Step 2. Upload Your File on Google Drive&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Access  and log in with your Gmail account. After you logged in, click on the &#039;Create&#039; button and add a new separate folder to upload your JavaScript and CSS files.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Open the newly created folder, and click on the Upload button with the upward arrow to choose the files that you need to upload. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Now, navigate to the location where you saved the files, select them (to select multiple files, press and hold down the Ctrl key on your keyboard and then click on them) and press the Open button.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;After the files have been successfully uploaded, right click on the file names (to select all your files in the folder, click on the checkbox) and select &#039;Share&#039;: &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the &#039;Sharing settings&#039; window, click on the &#039;Change&#039; link and choose the &#039;Public on the web&#039; option. Press &#039;Save&#039; and copy the link(s) of your uploaded file(s) from the &#039;Links to share&#039; box highlighted in blue, then paste it into a Notepad to use it later.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Step 3. How to Add an External CSS/JavaScript file to Blogger&lt;/h3&gt;Before you can use the links, you must replace &#039;&lt;b&gt;https://drive.google.com/file/d&lt;/b&gt;&#039; to &#039;&lt;b&gt;https://googledrive.com/host&lt;/b&gt;&#039; and remove &#039;&lt;b&gt;/edit?usp=sharing&lt;/b&gt;&#039; in the link.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example, the link to mycssfile.css that I copied looks like this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;https://drive.google.com/file/d/&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;0B4n9GL3eVuV-TkphMkc3SFR2Slk&lt;/span&gt;/edit?usp=sharing&lt;/blockquote&gt;Notice the part in blue after the &quot;/file/d/&quot; part. That is the file ID which is used to access it via the new hosting service. It should start with the following URL:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;https://googledrive.com/host/&lt;/blockquote&gt;Add the file ID like this (remove the &#039;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;/edit?usp=sharing&#039; part):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;https://googledrive.com/host/&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;0B4n9GL3eVuV-TkphMkc3SFR2Slk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Now log into your Blogger account, select your blog and go to Template &amp;gt; Edit HTML. Click anywhere inside the code area and press the CTRL + F keys to open the search box:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to add a CSS file, type the following tag inside the search box and hit Enter to find it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Just BELOW the &amp;lt;head&amp;gt; tag, add this line:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; href=&quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;https://googledrive.com/host/0B4n9GL3eVuV-TkphMkc3SFR2Slk&lt;/span&gt;&quot; /&amp;gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;And replace &lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;https://googledrive.com/host/0B4n9GL3eVuV-TkphMkc3SFR2Slk&lt;/span&gt; with the link of your CSS file:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to add a Javascript file, search for the following tag:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;And add this line just ABOVE it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;script src=&#039;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;https://googledrive.com/host/0B4n9GL3eVuV-eVYwLXBrTlZrVDg&lt;/span&gt;&#039; type=&#039;text/javascript&#039;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Replace the line in blue with your URL:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, press the &#039;Save template&#039; button to save the changes. And you&#039;re done!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;style&gt;.post-body ul li { list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 30px; } .post-body h4 { font-size: 17px; color: #777; } &lt;/style&gt;&lt;h4&gt;In Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;Once you have successfully saved all your file folders and closed out of the drive. Open your site in a browser and make sure that all the changes have completed successfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next time you want to edit any of the information or move internal files, all you have to do is open up the Google Drive folder on your account and make the modifications from that location. Those files will then automatically sync to the online folder and make updates to your site. This works the same if you want to change the appearance by modifying the CSS code to extend the header, footer, or make customizations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you can see, changing your file storage out so that is CSS and JavaScript is stored on your Google Drive account is easy to do and only takes a few minutes. After you make the change, you can begin benefiting from faster loading speeds, higher SEO rankings, and overall a more convenient platform to work from to increase the efficiency of your work.', 'admin', 'post', 3, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '1'),

In fact, there are about 152 million blogs out there on the internet. But, if you want your blog to stand out you need to impress visitors with the little things. You need to be able to catch there attention and keep it so that they want to come back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Complementing your blog post with images, links, and catchy titled is a great way to start and should be something you practice on just about everything you post; however, don&#039;t just stop there. If you really want to impress people and draw attention toward your blog, you want to start where the content all begins. You need to make use of custom fonts in Blogger. This guide will help you learn a little bit about font styles and how to upload new fonts onto your Blogger site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;ssmainhide&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #777;&quot;&gt;The Different Types of Font&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;Before you can upload any font files, you need to find the right font and typeface that will fit your style. Typeface is the design and symbols used for the letters; font is the actual characters. Some of the most common typeface terms that you should probably be familiar with before starting are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Serif - distinguished by small decorative lines that are attached to the end of letter strokes; best used for the paragraph or body content.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sans-serif - modern looking letter strokes that lack the decorate lines at the end; instead the letter end abruptly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Script - a handwriting typeface that looks like cursive letters or custom strokes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Display - typeface that is designed to stand out from the rest of the page; characterized by a broad and unique use of informal letter designs and transparency. Display typeface is best used on titles and headers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within each web browser there are also certain types of font files that are used. Most of the browsers, except Internet Explorer and the iOS browser, will use TTF font file. Internet Explorer is the only web browser service that uses EOS files, and Apple has opted for using an SVG for their mobile and tablet based products. Some custom fonts in Blogger have to be in an &lt;b&gt;@Font-Face&lt;/b&gt; kit, but this will be discussed later on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #777;&quot;&gt;Where to Find Font&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;You can find custom font all over the internet when you&#039;re ready to get started. Some custom fonts in Blogger are free to use and can be downloaded to your computer, others you are considered &#039;premium&#039; and you have to pay to use them, so please check twice whether they are having Commercial or Personal licenses. Google offers its own font service known as  which can be a good place to start looking around for custom fonts in Blogger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the Google Web Fonts service, you run a filter to find select fonts based on width, thickness, and slant. Better yet, you can test out how using the custom fonts in Blogger would appear by modifying the size, and viewing it in a small display window. If you like a couple different fonts, you can save them to your collection to come back to later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #777;&quot;&gt;Adding a Custom Font to Blogger from Google Web Font&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #674ea7;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 1. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;To browse the Google Fonts library, access . There are 650 font families in the collection right now, and they keep adding more, so you may want to sort them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To organize the fonts by style, you can use the menu on the left side. The top menu lets you to add and preview your own text using the &#039;Preview Text&#039; field. From the same menu, you can pick the &#039;Size&#039; and sort the fonts in &#039;Alphabetical order&#039;, by &#039;Date added&#039;, &#039;Number of styles&#039; and &#039;Popularity&#039;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #674ea7;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 2. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Once you decided what font you want to use, click on the &#039;Add to Collection&#039; button and then hit the &#039;Use&#039; tab. This will take you to the &#039;Almost done!&#039; page that will give you a &lt;b&gt;link to the style sheet&lt;/b&gt; found in the &#039;Standard&#039; tab (point 3) and the &lt;b&gt;CSS style&lt;/b&gt; (point 4).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The link to style sheet would look like this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;link href=&#039;http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=FONTNAME&#039; rel=&#039;stylesheet&#039; type=&#039;text/css&#039;&amp;gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;And the CSS style would look like this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;font-family: &#039;FONTNAME&#039;, cursive;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #674ea7;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 3. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Now that you have selected the fonts and have a general understanding of the different types of fonts available, you can head over to your Blogger blog. Open up the Dashboard and make sure that the first thing you do is to create a backup of your template: go to Template and press the &quot;Backup/Restore&quot; button on the upper right side. That way, you can revert the changes back to the original in case something goes wrong.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #674ea7;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 4.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; From the same &quot;Template&quot; location, press the &quot;Edit HTML&quot; button:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #674ea7;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 5. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Click anywhere inside the code area and press CTRL + F at the same time (PC) or Command + F (Mac) to open the Blogger&#039; search box and type &lt;span style=&quot;background-color: yellow;&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b:skin&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; inside the search box. Press Enter and it will take you to the &amp;lt;b:skin&amp;gt; tag, which will be highlighted in yellow:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #674ea7;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 6. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Directly above the &lt;span style=&quot;background-color: yellow;&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b:skin&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; tag, copy &amp;amp; paste the link to the style sheet provided by Google Web Fonts (step 2). To prevent any errors, add a forward slash (/) right before the closing angle bracket (&amp;gt;), like this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;link href=&#039;http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=FONTNAME&#039; rel=&#039;stylesheet&#039; type=&#039;text/css&#039; &lt;span style=&quot;background-color: yellow;&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #674ea7;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 7.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; To apply the font on a specific part of our blog, we&#039;ll need to find the CSS selector and add the &lt;b&gt;CSS style&lt;/b&gt; (point 4) just AFTER the curly bracket. If you don&#039;t know how to find the id/class selector, please read this tutorial: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example, if I would want to add the &quot;Rancho&quot; font to the posts and comments titles, I will paste the CSS style like this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;h3.post-title, .comments h4 {&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: white;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: #3d85c6;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp; font-family: &#039;Rancho&#039;, cursive;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&amp;nbsp; font-size: 28px;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;/blockquote&gt;Where &quot;h3.post-title, .comments h4 {&quot; is the class selector for the post and comments titles. Note: to change the size of your font, add the &quot;font-size: 28px;&quot; part as well, and change the &quot;28px&quot; value to make the font bigger/smaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also add the same CSS to &quot;Template&quot; &amp;gt; press the &quot;Customize&quot; button the right side, navigate to &quot;Advanced&quot; &amp;gt; &quot;Add CSS&quot; tab and paste the CSS code in the empty box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #674ea7;&quot;&gt;Step 8.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Finally, press the &quot;Save Template&quot; button and you&#039;re all set!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #777;&quot;&gt;Using a Custom Font that isn&#039;t on Google Web Fonts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;Some of the good places to find free fonts are ,  and . Click to download the kit (unzip it if necessary), and save the TFF or OFT file on your desktop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #777;&quot;&gt;Step 1: Convert the Font File&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;The font file that you&#039;ve downloaded is most likely in a TFF or OFT file since this is the most popular type. You need to convert this file into a @Font-Face kit. Many online services can help you do this, but here are two recommended sites:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are using the : press the &quot;Add Fonts&quot; button, choose the font file that you saved on your desktop and check the &quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #cc0000;&quot;&gt;Yes, the fonts I&#039;m uploading are legally eligible for web embedding.&lt;/span&gt;&quot; checkbox. After the font has been successfully uploaded, click the &quot;Download your kit&quot; button. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This should open the kit containing 4 formats of fonts (inside the fonts folder), a CSS stylesheet &amp;amp; the html file for the demo page. The only files that you need to extract are the ones with the &lt;b&gt;.woff&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;.tff&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;.svg&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;.eot&lt;/b&gt; extension and the &lt;b&gt;stylesheet.css&lt;/b&gt; file.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #777;&quot;&gt;Step 2: Upload The Font Files To Blogger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;Custom fonts in Blogger have to be uploaded before you can use them. For this, we are going to use  and upload them to  (upload only the files with the &lt;b&gt;.woff&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;.tff&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;.svg&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;.eot&lt;/b&gt; extension).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you&#039;ve uploaded them, copy the Public URL&#039;s of all 4 fonts: right click on each file, choose &quot;Copy public link...&quot; and press the &quot;Copy to clipboard&quot; button. Paste each link separately in a Notepad, so that you can link to that location later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, open up the &lt;b&gt;stylesheet.css&lt;/b&gt; file that came with the kit and it will show you a similar code:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;/* Generated by Font Squirrel (http://www.fontsquirrel.com) on September 2, 2014 */&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;@font-face {&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #cc0000;&quot;&gt;font-family: &#039;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;fontname&lt;/span&gt;&#039;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; src: url(&#039;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;font-name&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: yellow;&quot;&gt;.eot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#039;);&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; src: url(&#039;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;font-name&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: yellow;&quot;&gt;.eot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;?#iefix&#039;) format(&#039;embedded-opentype&#039;),&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; url(&#039;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;font-name&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: yellow;&quot;&gt;.woff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#039;) format(&#039;woff&#039;),&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; url(&#039;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;font-name&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: yellow;&quot;&gt;.ttf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#039;) format(&#039;truetype&#039;),&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; url(&#039;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;font-name&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: yellow;&quot;&gt;.svg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;#&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;fontname&lt;/span&gt;&#039;) format(&#039;svg&#039;);&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; font-weight: normal;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; font-style: normal;&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;/blockquote&gt;Edit the link location to point toward the font file that you just uploaded to the Dropbox Public folder and pay attention to each extension which should correspond with that found in the stylesheet.css file.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example, if you uploaded the font &lt;span style=&quot;background-color: yellow;&quot;&gt;.tff&lt;/span&gt; file with this name:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/62316253/amatic-bold-webfont&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: yellow;&quot;&gt;.ttf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;...change the CSS link in blue in this line:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;url(&#039;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;font-name&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: yellow;&quot;&gt;.ttf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#039;) format(&#039;truetype&#039;),&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;to point to:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;url(&#039;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/62316253/amatic-bold-webfont&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: yellow;&quot;&gt;.ttf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#039;) format(&#039;truetype&#039;),&lt;/blockquote&gt;After you&#039;ve added all the links, copy the stylesheet.css code that you modified to your clipboard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #777;&quot;&gt;Step 3: Editing Blogger&#039;s CSS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;Open up the CSS on your Blogger site. This can be found by navigating to Template &amp;gt; Edit HTML. Next, click inside the code area and press the CTRL + F keys to open the search box, then type the tag below and hit Enter to find it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;]]&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/b:skin&amp;gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Just ABOVE this tag, add the code that you copied in the &lt;b&gt;stylesheet.css&lt;/b&gt; file.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, we need to declare the custom font using CSS. For example, if I want to change the font of the post title, I will add the line in red from above, just below the &quot;h3.post-title, .comments h4 {&quot; CSS selector:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;h3.post-title, .comments h4 {&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #cc0000;&quot;&gt;font-family: &#039;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;fontname&lt;/span&gt;&#039;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;font-size: 28;&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;/blockquote&gt;Obviously, the &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;fontname&lt;/span&gt; will be the actual name of the font. This will make sure that your blog can use the custom fonts in Blogger. After we&#039;ve made these changes, press the &quot;Save Template&quot; button and exit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;style&gt;.post-body ul li { list-style-type: square; margin-left: 20px; } &lt;/style&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #777;&quot;&gt;Step 4: Test Out the Site&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;Navigate back to your sites homepage and you should now see the custom fonts in Blogger that you uploaded during the last few steps. Every time you go to make a new post, the site will now be able to use your font.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #777;&quot;&gt;In Conclusion:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;Website design is an important part to maintain a successful blog. As a blog owner, you are responsible for providing content that isn&#039;t just fun to read, but looks good. Modifying the font is just one easy way that you can help your blog stand out without making any major changes to your blog itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do you have any other methods for adding custom fonts?

This lets visitors see what your trending posts are right now and encourages them to click on them to read them. This basic widget is just a little too basic, however, for the modern day website visitor. Not only do they want to see your trending posts, but they also want to join the discussions that are happening on your blog. To do that, you&#039;ll need a most commented posts widget for Blogger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having a customized widget on your site is a lot easier than you might think. In order to have an effective widget, however, you&#039;re going to need a few specific things to help you out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Here&#039;s What You&#039;re Going To Get&lt;/h3&gt;There are certain aspects in the design of a most commented posts widget that you should expect. That&#039;s why you&#039;ll find these specific components with this custom widget:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;style&gt;.post-body ul li { list-style-type: disc; margin: 0px 20px 0px 40px; } &lt;/style&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ordered by popularity.&lt;/b&gt; The posts that have the most comments are the most likely to have visitors want to read the post and join in with the conversation. By ordering your posts based on the popularity of them, you&#039;ll give each visitor the chance to see what the hype really is about! This lets you have a charted graphic that gives a visitor easy recognition, but also allows you to keep it straight and aligned if you&#039;re looking for a cleaner look. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Graphic incorporation.&lt;/b&gt; Blog posts that have at least one graphic incorporated with them will receive 100% more traffic than posts that have no images at all. For every graphic that you include with a blog post, the more likely you are to get a click! The same is true with your most commented posts widget, so be sure to incorporate graphics that stand out with your design. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Descriptions that blend in.&lt;/b&gt; The internet today revolves around the value that you can provide each individual user. People don&#039;t just click on things because they look visually tempting. They click on them because they promise a level of value that another website like yours isn&#039;t able to provide. By having descriptions that blend in, you&#039;ll be able to enhance the perceived value that your site can provide. This leads to more clicks!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Related: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Add the Most Commented Posts Widget to Blogger&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 1.&lt;/b&gt; Log in to your  and go to Template, press the &quot;Edit HTML&quot; button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 2.&lt;/b&gt; Click anywhere inside the code area and press the CTRL + F keys to open the Blogger&#039; search box.

(6, '2014-10-11 17:49:12', 'How Firebug Helps You Design Your Blogger Blog', 'how-firebug-helps-you-design-your-blogger-blog', 'For most bloggers, the idea of adjusting the coding of their blog to improve the user experience is daunting at best and often quite frightening. HTML5, CSS, and other coding elements are their own virtual language and for the average Blogger user looking to update a personal blog, the automatic settings are about as good as it gets. What if there was a better way to code a blog, whether a beginner or a pro, that could be done within the browser itself?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#039;re using Firefox or Chrome, then you should also be using Firebug. It allows you to code your website in real time, so you can maximize the UX of your blog in no time at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;ssmainhide&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;You No Longer Need To Edit Through Blogger!&lt;/h3&gt;If you&#039;ve ever tried to update a Blogger theme through the editing functions of the website, then you know how difficult it can be. You can preview your designs, but you can&#039;t save any changes to officially see what is going to happen with your site until you publish the edits. If you&#039;ve missed just one line of code or forgotten one small element, you&#039;re going to have to go back into the editing matrix, find the error, update it again, and repeat until you have a responsive blog once again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What Firebug allows you to do is see all of those elements that make up a website in real time. Instead of editing and then publishing, you can edit in real time and see updates happen, all without affecting the user experiences of visitors that are coming to your site while you&#039;re editing. You can change the fonts, colors, or virtually anything else within the design of the site quickly and see the results of your work as it happens. Don&#039;t like it? Just undo your changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#039;s really that easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Using Firebug to Customize CSS in Blogger&lt;/h2&gt;This guide will show you how to modify the CSS code of a Blogger template. Usually, the Blogger Template CSS style declarations are editable through the style.css file, found between the &lt;span style=&quot;background-color: yellow;&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b:skin&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style=&quot;background-color: yellow;&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/b:skin&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; tags.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To download Firebug and get more details regarding its powerful features, visit:  for Firefox, or if you are using Chrome, get the  app. I would recommend to use Firefox, which is more complete and quick, but, nevertheless, both work the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once Firebug is installed, a small bug icon will be available in the upper right of your Web browser&#039;s address bar. Clicking it, a horizontally split screen will be shown at the bottom of the browser&#039;s window. The page will continue to show in the upper half, while the lower half will show the HTML of the current web page.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To customize any web element from a Blogger template, just click either on the Firebug icon in the toolbar, or the &quot;Inspect Element with Firebug&quot; item in the context menu. Next, click the blue cursor button to Inspect and place the cursor right over the element to customize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example, let&#039;s say that we want to change the title of the &quot;Blog Archive&quot; gadget. After we clicked the inspect button, mouse over the &quot;Blog Archive&quot; title which will be highlighted as shown in the screenshot below. To change this element, click on it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that we decided which element we want to change, right click on the &quot;Style&quot; panel and select the &quot;Add rule&quot; option:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will give the class or the id of the highlighted element - in our case, the heading of the Blog Archive (#BlogArchive1 &amp;gt; h2). To edit this rule that we just added, click anywhere near the left curly bracket that will open a text box, so that we can type a new CSS declaration:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And here comes the fun part. Let&#039;s say that we want to make the title red. We will type &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #6aa84f;&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and hit Enter, then we will type the color value or the &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #674ea7;&quot;&gt;red&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; text and hit Enter. We will also set the set the font size to 20px, text alignment to center (text-align: center) and make the text underlined (text-decoration: underline):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cool thing about Firebug is that when modifying any CSS property, you can see the results directly applied on the page. So, after adding these declarations, we&#039;ll see a big red underlined title for our Blog Archive gadget (see in the screenshot above).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To apply this CSS rule on a Blogger template, just select it beginning from the right curly bracket and to the #(id) or .(class) symbol, then right click it and Copy the CSS code.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before making any change, it&#039;s highly recommended to make a backup of your current template. Go to &quot;Template&quot; and click the &quot;Backup/Restore&quot; button on the upper right side. On the same &quot;Template&quot; location, click on the &quot;Customize&quot; button and navigate to &quot;Advanced&quot; &amp;gt; &quot;Add CSS&quot;. Paste the CSS rule that you just copied into the CSS box:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Click the &quot;Apply to blog&quot; button on the upper right corner to save the changes and view your blog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Firebug Also Gives You One Distinct Advantage...&lt;/h3&gt;One of the best reasons to install Firebug into Chrome or Firefox is that it allows you to emulate some of your favorite website designs quickly and easily. Instead of hiring a web designer to do the work, which could cost you thousands, you can simply start Firebug and see what the CSS styles are for your favorite site. This allows you to create a similar widget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From there, all you&#039;ve got to do is change the coding to make the design elements work under the rules of your own custom.css. This means you can make easy design changes to your Blogger blog without having to go through all of the menus and editing functions so that your template can truly be your own. Do you have some work to do? Sure - but Firebug does all of the primary work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All you&#039;ve got to do is have a creative mind and a few minutes to make changes to the coding design. Whether you&#039;ve been coding for years or are just starting your first blog, this is definitely the best way to make sure that your visitors have the best experience possible!', 'admin', 'post', 3, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '1'),

But when Pinterest decided to enter the social media mix, it upped the ante in a big way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pinterest lets blog owners use their service to add a &#039;pin&#039; to photos or content images on the site. When visitors of that site see a photo they like, they can choose to click on the red Pinterest button for Blogger, and add it to their Pinterest account.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The person who pressed your Pinterest button for Blogger can now see your photo on their dashboard, and share it with friends or followers on the service. They can also come across this photo when users add keywords or category tags to the image. More importantly, that photo links to your site when clicked on and will contain a description title of your blog name or post.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;ssmainhide&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Therefore, adding the Pinterest button for Blogger will help you to benefit from tons of new traffic coming from Pinterest and people who had found your photos and post links using the service. Here are some steps to add your very own Pinterest button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. Access your Blogger Template&lt;/h3&gt;The first thing to do is to edit the code of your template so that it knows when to display this Pinterest Button for Blogger with the content. You can do this by logging into your Blogger Dashboard and finding your way to &quot;Template&quot; &amp;gt; &quot;Edit HTML&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the editor opens up, it may look a bit foreign to you if you don&#039;t have much experience using HTML. Click anywhere inside the code area and search by pressing the CTRL + F keys for the &lt;span style=&quot;background-color: yellow;&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; tag - hit Enter to find it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The body tags makes up the general content in your webpage. Think of it like the settings panel of a website. If you were to delete everything in this section your site would turn into a blank white page.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. Add The Pinterest Pin it Script&lt;/h3&gt;Once you found the &lt;span style=&quot;background-color: yellow;&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; tag, insert the following script just above it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;//&amp;lt;![CDATA[&lt;br /&gt;var custom_pinit_button = &quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-3CPCJ031n9M/U_vWZXUV1SI/AAAAAAAAKPA/8Q3N34ieaBw/s1600/pinit-button.png&lt;/span&gt;&quot;;&lt;br /&gt;var pinit_button_position = &quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #cc0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;center&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&quot;;&lt;br /&gt;var pinit_button_before = &quot;&quot;;&lt;br /&gt;var pinit_button_after = &quot;&quot;;&lt;br /&gt;//]]&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;script src=&#039;http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.8.2/jquery.min.js&#039; type=&#039;text/javascript&#039;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;script id=&#039;pinit-img-button&#039; src=&#039;http://helplogger.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pinterest-button1.js&#039; type=&#039;text/javascript&#039;&amp;gt; &lt;br /&gt;// Visit helplogger.blogspot.com for more widgets and tricks.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. Changing the Position of the Pin it! button&lt;/h3&gt;The cool thing about this code is that you have some freedom over where the Pinterest button for Blogger will go over the image. Take a look at the code that you just copied and pasted into the HTML for the word &#039;center&#039;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;var pinit_button_position = &quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #cc0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;center&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&quot;;&lt;/blockquote&gt;To move the pin to a different area of the photo, replace &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #cc0000;&quot;&gt;center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; with one of these texts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;topleft&lt;br /&gt;topright&lt;br /&gt;bottomleft&lt;br /&gt;bottomright&lt;/blockquote&gt;And to change the Pin it! button that appears on mouse over, replace the address in blue from above with your own:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;var custom_pinit_button = &quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-3CPCJ031n9M/U_vWZXUV1SI/AAAAAAAAKPA/8Q3N34ieaBw/s1600/pinit-button.png&lt;/span&gt;&quot;; &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4. Save The Template&lt;/h3&gt;Make sure that you added everything correctly, then save the template and navigate to a recent post that you made that contain images. Hover your mouse over the image and you should now see a red Pinterest button for Blogger displayed on the image. Test it out and see it how it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to hide the pinit button from a specific image, when you create a post, switch to the HTML tab of your post editor and type &lt;span style=&quot;background-color: yellow;&quot;&gt;class=&quot;nopin&quot;&lt;/span&gt; right before the closing slash and angle bracket of your image element, like this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside of this button is that it doesn&#039;t take the information from your custom image titles. It&#039;s automatically set to take the title of the blog post where the image is located. So, you&#039;ll need to pay closer attention to the title of the posts so that it fits closely with the images being shown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember that when you have this code activated, you have to label your titles so that they are relevant to the photos you are posting. This might sound obvious, but sometimes you create a post with an image as a joke that won&#039;t make sense in the context of viewing it on Pinterest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use , you can start to see traffic flooding into your site from Pinterest. You should also create your own Pinterest account so that you can manage the content and track how it&#039;s being shared. That&#039;s it.

If you are using a site like WordPress or Joomla! that depends on templates, you may just have to add the tracking code on the main HTML index file. Keep in mind that it can take upwards of 24-hours for Google to begin collecting information and importing that data to your dashboard, so don&#039;t expect to see measurable results right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tutorial: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Researching the Data&lt;/h3&gt;Once you insert the code into your site, it will begin tracking data from anyone who visits your site. This data is then sent back to the Google servers and stored in your Google Analytics profile. From there, you can determine what type of information that you want to look at.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two features of Google Analytics that are often most useful to new users is the ability to track where customers are coming from, and the ability to see keywords that have been effective in drawing in audiences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Traffic Origins&lt;/h3&gt;Open up your Google Analytics dashboard and click on &#039;&lt;b&gt;Acquisition&lt;/b&gt;&#039;. You should see a few options, but you want to pull &#039;&lt;b&gt;All Referrals&lt;/b&gt;&#039; so that you can the entire list of visitors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next to the referral path will show a few links with a number of how many people visited your site from that link. From here you can click on the link and find out the reason for the traffic. Maybe someone has written a review on the service, you can check to see if the advertisement campaign you are operating is producing results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Keywords&lt;/h3&gt;Within the same &#039;&lt;b&gt;Acquisition&lt;/b&gt;&#039; directory is another option called &#039;&lt;b&gt;Search Engine Optimization&lt;/b&gt;&#039;. Click on this link and then click on &#039;&lt;b&gt;Queries&lt;/b&gt;&#039; to look up a list of keywords being used to describe your site. The dashboard will display an overview of up to 1,000 words or phrases used on Google that brought new visitors to your site. You can use this information to modify your posts and producing content to increase the results of certain key phrases that you feel would benefit your customer outreach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Demographics&lt;/h3&gt;Underneath the audience tab, you can also track demographics. This little option will allow you to view the age, gender, and interests of individual users and segments of your visiting population. Say for example you run a senior care facility for the retired and want to put together a A/B split test to determine which advertising campaign works best. After adding the campaign to a landing page or section of your site, you can look back and find out if retired citizens are the ones responding to your ads, or if you are just bringing in traffic from younger generations who may not be interested in your services.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Custom Campaign Tagging&lt;/h3&gt;Custom campaign tagging is more of an advanced feature, but once you get used to the Google Analytics interface, you can use this to separate your campaigns and easily filter through data. Maybe you just want to find out who is coming to your site from your email newsletters, and not from the general site. Google Analytics will allow you to post special links to your content on those channels of communication and then view these results under the acquisition tab and then campaigns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Determining What Works, and What Doesn&#039;t&lt;/h3&gt;Using the tools that Google Analytics provides at your disposal allows you to really determine what type of experience you want to provide your customers. Within the first month of use, if start to see trends or patterns in data that you feel you feel you can improve upon, you can use this information as a guide to edit your sites design and layout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting used to the program might seem overwhelming at first, but once you jump right in and start playing around all the features, you&#039;ll get the hang of it in no time. Google Analytics really is an important tool that every website owner should have. ', 'admin', 'post', 3, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '1'),

Whenever a visitor accesses your blog for the first time, the header is one major aspect that is used to determine who you are and the type of content that they can expect to read. Therefore, it&#039;s important to develop a header that is both prominently placed and telling of your brand name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What would seem to be counterintuitive to that idea is the default Blogger settings for header positioning. Whenever you upload a header to the site, it will automatically be aligned to the left of the page. Some Blogger users may be okay with this setting, especially if they are using a header design that doesn&#039;t contain a background. Others may find that their background headers appear cut off, incomplete, or indistinguishable from the rest of their content.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you find yourself in the second category of users, there is a way to adjust the positioning of your header so that it is displayed as a center Blogger header. By centering your site header, you have greater flexibility over the overall design, and it allows you to really shine light on this content. It&#039;s hard to miss a header that is placed smack dab in the middle of the screen on every page that someone navigates to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Center Header Image with Blogger Template Designer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Making the change is relatively easy.

All you need to do is to modify the CSS of your blog that can be found directly through your Blogger dashboard.

Default templates come in handy, but the nice things about owning your own blog is that you have the chance to add your own personal touch. As a matter of fact, templates aren&#039;t made to restrict your freedom of design, but instead they&#039;re there to provide you a foundation to build from. With every default template available on Blogger, you can make changes to fit your style. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the most common requests out of the Blogger community when making alterations is how to change the look of some of the key sections like headers, navigation, and footers. Initially, these items are designed to fit within just 1/3 of the page, surrounded by padding and margins on either side. These margins are used to give the page a slim fitting appearance, but could also cause your content to look compressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Important: Backup your Template&lt;/h4&gt;Making the changes to a full screen Blogger navigation, footer, or header can be done and won&#039;t take you much time. Before you can make any changes, you should save extra copies of the template .xml file in case anything goes wrong.

When you return to the screen that asks for size, click on the &quot;Original size&quot; option and confirm your choice. Your newly added image will then be displayed with the adjustments that you created, so that it fits nicely the width of the post area.', 'admin', 'post', 3, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '1'),

If you notice any darkening of the pictures themselves, especially in light-colored areas of the photo, you are seeing the results of a Blogger auto-enhancing feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Blogger auto-enhancing feature is packaged within the service and is intended to give your photos a more professional feel. It works by smoothing out fuzzy photos and removing any imperfections in personal photos, so that you see your best looking you. However, you may realize that not every picture that you upload needs to undergo this enhancement. In fact, it may even cause your site to look dull or outdated as it can turn white photos gray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table align=&quot;center&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;tr-caption-container&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;tr-caption&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;The second picture was auto-enhanced, while the first one was not&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Turning Off Picture Auto-Enhancement on Google Plus&lt;/h2&gt;Fortunately, there is a way to adjust these settings so that you&#039;re able to turn them on and off at will. You may be surprised to know that the root cause of these changes actually lies with the Google uploader and your decision to link your Google+ and Blogger accounts together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Step 1: Access Your Google Account&lt;/h3&gt;Blogger is just one of the many services that make up the Google network. When the company released Google+, this Blogger auto-enhancing feature came with it because adjustments were made to the Google uploading service. These same changes take place when you&#039;re adding pictures from your library in Picasa. The good thing about Google is that they allow you to make adjustments to your settings from one central location by navigating over to your Google account. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to turn the &quot;Auto Enhance&quot; feature off, go to your Blogger dashboard, and click your icon in the top right corner, then the blue &quot;View Profile&quot; button (if you are not using Google+, click the &quot;Account settings&quot; link). Now you&#039;ll be taken over to your Google+ profile or settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Step 2: Find The Enhancement Settings&lt;/h3&gt;Once opening your Google account, look for the tab on the top left corner of the page that says Profile &amp;gt; navigate to Settings - or if you are using a Blogger profile, click the &quot;Edit settings&quot; link under &quot;Google+ settings&quot;. This will bring up a list with &quot;Photos and Videos&quot; options including &quot;Show geo locationâ€¦&quot; and &quot;Allow viewers to download my photos...&quot;. Look toward the bottom of the list for the &#039;Auto Enhance&#039; heading and check the &quot;Off&quot; option to turn this feature off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Step 3: Auto Enhance on Photos You&#039;ve Already Uploaded&lt;/h3&gt;Any picture that you upload from here on out will no longer be subject to this Blogger auto-enhancement feature; however, this will not revert any pictures that have already been uploaded. If you want to make any changes to photos that were uploaded during this period, do the following: from the same panel, click on the &#039;Photos&#039; tab which it will take you to the albums for each blog &amp;gt; click on the blog where you wish to disable the auto enhance effect and press the down arrow &amp;gt; go to the &quot;Apply Auto Enhance&quot; option and choose &#039;Off&#039;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Notice The Results?&lt;/h3&gt;Now that the auto-enhancement feature is turned off, you may start to see different results when uploading.

(13, '2014-10-14 05:45:16', 'How to Optimize Images for Better Search Engine Rankings', 'how-to-optimize-images-for-better-search-engine-rankings', 'When search engines start indexing the pages on your site, they don&#039;t just focus on the writing. Web crawlers employed by services like Google and Bing shuffle through your site&#039;s structural code looking for any relevant information that they might offer to their customers. Some of the information includes things like backlinks, tags and even images.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Images make up a big part of any website. They help to excite the visual senses of readers and offer a little extra entertainment value. What most blog owners don&#039;t realize is that all of the photos that they upload to their site aren&#039;t confined to their site alone. Crawlers make sure that these images also show up within their respective search engines sites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Image searches can have the effect of drawing in large numbers of new readers that were just looking through content in Google images. You can benefit from this traffic and increase your average subscriber by practicing image optimization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;ssmainhide&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Image Optimization Tip #1: Alt Tags &amp;amp; File Names&lt;/h2&gt;Visitors may love images, but computers don&#039;t. Computers are designed to do what you tell them without violating any of the parameters. When web crawlers come across images on a website, they really don&#039;t know what to do with it because they are made to collect information, not interpret it. The solution to this problem is to optimize images and appropriately label your alt tags so that they display the correct content when someone goes to look for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example, let&#039;s say you upload a picture of your dog, and label the &quot;alt&quot; tag by the dog&#039;s name, &#039;Frank&#039;. The web crawler is going to read the alt tag without ever realizing it&#039;s a picture of a dog; therefore, the crawler will come to the conclusion that it needs to display the image when someone run a search for &#039;Frank&#039;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The minor word choice mistakes may not affect the operations of your website, or how your image is displayed, but it will affect the search results of others and the traffic that comes into your website. Whereas you may have been able to attract the dog lovers in the world using image optimization of your dog tagged &#039;dog&#039;, you are now drawing in crowds searching for their uncle &quot;Frank&quot;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To include the alt tag, simply add &lt;span style=&quot;color: #0b5394;&quot;&gt;alt=&quot;this is your alt text&quot;&lt;/span&gt; to your image tag. Here&#039;s an example:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&amp;lt;img src=&quot;pug-dog.jpg&quot; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #0b5394;&quot;&gt;alt=&quot;frank dog&quot;&lt;/span&gt; /&amp;gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;But you don&#039;t have to touch the html code of the image. Once the picture is uploaded, click on it and you will see the &quot;Properties&quot; setting. Add the alt text inside the box and hit OK:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This goes the same for file names on a website. You need to optimize images and file names on everything that you decide to save to your website directory so that this information can be appropriately indexed and be used as a search term. You could name the file of your dog Frank, &quot;pug-dog.jpg&quot;, which would encourage the search engine to add Frank into searches being performed with the phrase &#039;pug dog&#039;. Alt tags and file names play an important interpretation role between you and the machine that makes your blog possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Image Optimization Tip #2: Add A Caption&lt;/h2&gt;After uploading your images, you should always add a caption to the image, so that average browser understands what they&#039;re looking at. This gives your website a more professional appearance and will help to keep people on your page.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not everyone that comes across your picture using a Google Image search is looking for your blog. Maybe they just want to download the image, and that&#039;s all you&#039;ll ever get from them. The important thing is that they found your photo relevant to their search, and decided to navigate to your site in order to save it for their own use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The longer those users stay on the site, the better it looks for you because it plays a role in the &quot;bounce rate&quot;. Bounce rate refers to when someone clicks on a link, realizes it&#039;s not what they&#039;re looking for, and then immediately goes back to the search engine. If you can reduce the number of times that this happens by providing captions and intriguing content that will make people want to stick around, your SEO ranking will improve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table align=&quot;center&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;tr-caption-container&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;tr-caption&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Image caption and SEO&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Image Optimization Tip #3: File Size&lt;/h2&gt;Improving your bounce rate can be tough because the attention span of the everyday Internet user is incredibly short. It may be as short as 8 seconds. High bounce back rates and slow loading sites can be the death of most blogs because no one wants to wait for the content to load. By the time your website finally loads with the content that you need, they could have easily visited two or more sites and found what they need from someone who was better prepared to handle their traffic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Optimize images so that you are able to keep the file size as small as possible while retaining the quality of the photo. Images taken from DSLR camera - although they may look great - can be up to 1.4 MB in size if you take them directly off your camera and upload them on your blog. This type of space is massive for any everyday blog, and will hurt your SEO ratings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use Photoshop or one of many online services like Google Picasa to rescale your images or reduce the file size. Two services that can perform this ability for free and do a great job are and . When you access either site, they will allow you to upload the picture on the site and download the new image optimization versions for use on your Blogger site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Putting It All Together&lt;/h3&gt;At the end of the day, the quality of your site and overall SEO ranking isn&#039;t just about what you have to say. It&#039;s the entire package of what you have to offer. Optimize images every chance you get and use the strategies discussed above. Now that you know that you might have been neglecting images all along, you can make necessary adjustments and start to see even better results from all your hard work.', 'admin', 'post', 3, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '1'),
(14, '2014-10-28 02:48:13', 'Blogger vs WordPress: Which is Better for You?', 'blogger-vs-wordpress-which-is-better-for-you', 'There are two big-name services in the world of blogging: Blogger vs WordPress. No matter where you go on the internet looking for advice, these two names are nearly impossible to avoid because they play such an important role within the online content community.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#039;re just starting out a new blog, or making some major changes to your current layout, you&#039;ll most likely be faced with the decision to choose between Blogger vs WordPress. Both are stellar services that are going to make your life as a blogger much easier, but ultimately, your decision must come down to one. So don&#039;t cross over, let&#039;s walk this path together and ensure that you don&#039;t get lost in the wonder world of web, looking for answers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Before we start!&lt;/h3&gt;WordPress as you might have noticed, comes in two different flavors, wordpress.org and wordpress.com. Seemingly same, but practically, not. Like in Blogger vs WordPress, hosting at wordpress.com is like renting a corporate apartment where the corporate is responsible for maintenance and facilitation of your place. While hosting at wordpress.org is similar to buying your own apartment, where you are responsible for your place&#039;s security,  maintenance and many others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, wherever in this post you see the word &#039;WordPress&#039;; know that it refers to wordpress.org.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;User-Friendliness&lt;/h2&gt;WordPress is a clear front-runner in the blogging and web design community in terms of how many people actually use the platform. The founder of WordPress, Matt Mullenweg, provided eye-opening statistics that around 18.9% of the entire Internet runs on WordPress. Compared to a 2012 study done by Blogging.org, of all the actual blogs on the Internet, WordPress makes up 43%, Blogger 35%, and the remaining blogs are Tumblr or other less known services.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, just because something is used more often than another, it doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s easier to use. The problem with WordPress is that it wasn&#039;t designed for beginners who just want to take up blogging as a side hobby. In order to set up your own WordPress blog, you have to have some previous knowledge of things like hosting, bandwidth, HTML and SEO practices. There are WordPress services out there that will help set up your site and get you online, but WordPress itself comes as a set of files that you are expected to download and configure to your own site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some hosting companies have made the idea of using WordPress a little bit easier with things like one-click downloads; but it&#039;s still a pretty steep learning curve for new bloggers to overcome. You also have to deal with paying for the costs of hosting your site and acquiring the domain name. If you opt to use one of the many WordPress services instead of setting it up yourself, you&#039;ll be stuck with a URL such as &#039;yourwebsite.wordpress.com&#039;, which takes away from the professional image you may be trying to portray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blogger is entirely based on Google and makes setting up a blog a breeze. With Blogger vs WordPress all you need to get started is to sign up for the service using your Google account, or make a new account like you would if you were setting up an email account. From there, Blogger takes responsibility for all your files, backing up the systems and the details associated with operating a content site like a database. Blogger is so much easier in terms of walking you through the steps, providing you with everything you need to be successful and it&#039;s at little-to-no cost to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Design &amp;amp; Customizability&lt;/h2&gt;Hosting at WordPress means stepping into the Disney world. With hundreds of featured rich-customizable design templates, you would find yourself literally lost in the WordPress arena, ensuring that your site looks unique, catchy and simply marvelous to visitors. The wide array of WordPress templates include customized designs for nearly every walk of life including fashion, entertainment, music, health, kitchen, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blogger themes, some would say, are not responsive; but let me tell you a secret. With a little search online, you can find hundreds of free, highly customizable, responsive templates that you can easily integrate into your blog, so that you and your site visitors stay in touch with your blog through their handsets. For WordPress, however, you don&#039;t need to wander around. By default, it has rich and responsive native designs, making WordPress ideal for mobile bloggers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both platforms will allow you to make modifications to the theme and features of the site if you have experience or feel comfortable to use HTML and CSS. They also both provide helpful post areas for when you go to submit new content. These post areas will also include HTML and some basic functions to change the font style and the size of your text.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One design feature between the two that may tip the scale toward Blogger in the Blogger vs WordPress discussion is that Blogger is integrated with other Google services like Google Picasa. Picasa is a photo sharing site that will allow you to share all your personal photos, or the photos that you plan on using within your posts. These can then be accessed via the text editor when you are submitting content and can be easily included with the content. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gadgets, Widgets &amp;amp; Plugins&lt;/h2&gt;Talking of plugins, WordPress provides you with thousands of easy to integrate plugins from security to multimedia, enabling you to add any feature or functionality in your site, in a couple easy steps. Users of this platform have submitted thousands of independent plugins that you can install for just about anything you would need, from SEO to E-commerce. There are so many interesting plugins available, that blog owners often make the mistake of cluttering their site with too many and distracting their readers from the content.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blogger may not have as many plugins or widgets as WordPress, it does have enough to provide you with what you need. Blogger&#039;s simplicity in many ways provides it with an edge over WordPress because you are able to focus most of your time in producing great content, instead of seeing how many bells and whistles you can add on the site. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The SEO Question&lt;/h2&gt;Not every person that starts a blog is looking to make money off the content; some people just like to write for the sake of writing. Whatever your goals are for starting the blog, search engine optimization - or SEO for short - is a key strategy in growing your readership, so others might enjoy what you have to share.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over 1 quadrillion searches are performed via Google each year. The goal of most SEO producers is to implement strategies that can appease Google so that their content will be ranked higher up in search query results. Blogger is a service created by Google, so it&#039;s obvious that they added their own formulas to the service to ensure that those blogs are doing what they need to do to be found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sticking to Blogger means Google would optimize your blog itself from a SEO perspective. All you need to do is check / uncheck a couple of options from your dashboard and Google will start crawling your site with just a click of a button. WordPress takes a hands-on approach that will require you to know a little bit more to modify your website design and content to meet these standards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;And the Blogger vs WordPress Winner Isâ€¦&lt;/h2&gt;In terms of Blogger vs WordPress, both services might be worth trying out, but ultimately Blogger comes out as a winner in all four categories discussed above. For new or returning bloggers, it is a fantastic service that makes it easy to focus on what you love, regardless of all the add-ons and fancy additions of WordPress. Blogger&#039;s simplicity is perhaps one of it&#039;s greatest advantages and provides bloggers of all experience levels a chance to succeed.', 'admin', 'post', 3, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '1'),

It&#039;s increasingly become a knowledge hub for strollers around the globe. And you know what the best part is? It does not have a religion, race or color, that&#039;s where perhaps its strength lies in. Point being, no matter what you are after, from details of products to how to use them, from fruit varieties to language origins, from how to hack Facebook account to how to set up a custom domain name in Blogger. Each and everything is there, in abundance and easily available. Now I know you are here to understand how you can setup/host your custom domain on your Blogger account. So let&#039;s get on with it, without further delay. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;ssmainhide&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Before we start&lt;/h3&gt;It&#039;s important that you realize, it isn&#039;t difficult to add a custom domain into your blogger account. If you are a blogger, it&#039;s perfect if you already own your own blog, it shows your passion and love for blogging and provides you with freedom to move from one platform to another, when and if you need. Also from users perspective, it&#039;s much easier for them to remember and visit your blog at customized address like &lt;i&gt;myblog.com&lt;/i&gt; than &lt;i&gt;myblog.blogspot.com&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the best things about Blogger is that it does not push you to host your site with blogger. It is entirely your own choice to choose from either of two hosting plans &#039;hosting on BlogSpot&#039; with address myblog.blogspot.com, or going with a custom domain with address myblog.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Some Popular Web Hosting Sites:&lt;/h3&gt;If you don&#039;t already have purchased yourself a custom domain, these are the places that you should be looking for to get one:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- EasyDNS&lt;br /&gt;- 1and1&lt;br /&gt;- GoDaddy.com&lt;br /&gt;- Yahoo! Small Business&lt;br /&gt;- No-IP&lt;br /&gt;- ix web hosting&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So now if you have bought yourself a domain, from either of these you would have an IP address and a name. Let&#039;s assume our is &#039;mynewdomain&#039;.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, it&#039;s time to start adding a custom domain to your blogger account.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Remember:&lt;/h3&gt;Here we are using setup for , the most popular domain name provider. For custom domains from other sites, the steps are almost same, so don&#039;t vanish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Setting Up Blogger Custom Domain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #3d85c6;&quot;&gt;Step 1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.

Or maybe you don&#039;t want search engines spiders to crawl through your pages? Or you do have a technical background but don&#039;t want to risk making changes without expert&#039;s words on topic? Well in either case, this is the right place for you to be. In this tutorial, you will see how to add Custom Robots.txt file in Blogger in a few easy steps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;ssmainhide&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But before we open and start working on Robots.txt, let&#039;s have a brief overview of its significance:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Warning!&lt;/span&gt; Use with caution. Incorrect use of these features can result in your blog being ignored by search engines.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What is Robots.txt?&lt;/h3&gt;With every blog that you create/post on your site, a related Robots.txt file is auto-generated by Blogger. The purpose of this file is to inform incoming robots (spiders, crawlers etc. sent by search engines like Google, Yahoo) about your blog, its structure and to tell whether or not to crawl pages on your blog. You as a blogger would like certain pages of your site to be indexed and crawled by search engines, while others you might prefer not to be indexed, like a label page, demo page or any other irrelevant page.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How do they see Robots.txt?&lt;/h3&gt;Well, Robots.txt is the first thing these spiders view as soon as they reach your site. Your Robots.txt is like a hour flight attendant, that directs you to your seat and keep checking that you don&#039;t enter private areas. Therefore, all the incoming spiders would only index files that Robots.txt would tell to, keeping others saved from indexing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Where is Robots.txt located?&lt;/h3&gt;You can easily view your Robots.txt file either on your browser by adding &lt;i&gt;/robots.txt&lt;/i&gt; to your blog address like &lt;i&gt;http://myblog.blogspot.com/robots.txt&lt;/i&gt; or by simply signing into your blog and choosing Settings &amp;gt; Search engine Preference &amp;gt; Crawlers and indexing and selecting Edit next to Custom robots.txt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How Robots.txt does looks like?&lt;/h3&gt;If you haven&#039;t touched your robots.txt file yet, it should look something like this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #cc0000;&quot;&gt;User-agent: Mediapartners-Google&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #cc0000;&quot;&gt;Disallow:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #38761d;&quot;&gt;User-agent: *&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #38761d;&quot;&gt;Disallow: /search&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #38761d;&quot;&gt;Allow: /&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #3d85c6;&quot;&gt;Sitemap: http://myblog.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?orderby=UPDATED&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Don&#039;t worry if it isn&#039;t colored or there isn&#039;t any line breaks in code, I colored it and placed line breaks so that you may understand what these words mean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #cc0000;&quot;&gt;User-agent:Media partners-Google:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mediapartners-Google is Google&#039;s AdSense robot that would often crawl your site looking for relevant ads to serve on your blog or site. If you disallow this option, they won&#039;t be able to see any ads on your specified posts or pages. Similarly, if you are not using Google AdSense ads on your site, simply remove both these lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #38761d;&quot;&gt;User-agent: *&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those of you with little programming experience must have guessed the symbolic nature of character &#039;*&#039; (wildcard). For others, it specifies that this portion (and the lines beneath) is for all of you incoming spiders, robots, and crawlers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #38761d;&quot;&gt;Disallow: /search&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keyword &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Disallow&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, specifies the &#039;not to&#039; do things for your blog. Add &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;/search&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; next to it, and that means you are guiding robots not to crawl the search pages &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;/search&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; results of your site. Therefore, a page result like &lt;i&gt;http://myblog.blogspot.com/search/label/mylabel&lt;/i&gt; will never be crawled and indexed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #38761d;&quot;&gt;Allow: /&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keyword &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Allow&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; specifies &#039;to do&#039; things for your blog. Adding &#039;/&#039; means that the robot may crawl your homepage. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #3d85c6;&quot;&gt;Sitemap:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keyword &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sitemap&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; refers to our blogs sitemap; the given code here tells robots to index every new post. By specifying it with a link, we are optimizing it for efficient crawling for incoming guests, through which incoming robots will find path to our entire blog posts links, ensuring none of our posted blog posts will be left out from the SEO perspective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However by default, the robot , so if you want to increase the number of index files, then replace the sitemap link with this one:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #3d85c6;&quot;&gt;Sitemap: http://myblog.blogspot.com/atom.xml?redirect=false&amp;amp;start-index=1&amp;amp;max-results=500&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;And if you have more than 500 published posts, then you can use these two sitemaps like below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #3d85c6;&quot;&gt;Sitemap: http://myblog.blogspot.com/atom.xml?redirect=false&amp;amp;start-index=1&amp;amp;max-results=500&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #3d85c6;&quot;&gt;Sitemap: http://myblog.blogspot.com/atom.xml?redirect=false&amp;amp;start-index=500&amp;amp;max-results=1000 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How to prevent posts/pages from being indexed and crawled?&lt;/h3&gt;In case you haven&#039;t yet discovered yourself, here is how to stop spiders from crawling and indexing particular pages or posts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Disallow Particular Post &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;Disallow: /yyyy/mm/post-url.html&lt;/blockquote&gt;The &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;/yyy/mm&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; part specifies your blog posts publishing year and month and &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;/post-url.html&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is the page you want them not to crawl. To prevent a post from being indexed/crawled simply copy the URL of your post that you want to exclude from indexing and remove the blog address from the beginning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Disallow Particular Page&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To disallow a particular page, you can use the same method as above. Just copy the page URL and remove your blog address from it, so that it will look something like this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;Disallow: /p/page-url.html&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Adding Custom Robots.Txt to Blogger&lt;/h2&gt;Now let&#039;s see how exactly you can &lt;b&gt;add Custom Robots.txt file in Blogger&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Sign in to you blogger account and click on your blog.&lt;br /&gt;2. Go to Settings &amp;gt; Search Preferences&amp;nbsp; &amp;gt; Crawlers and indexing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Select &#039;Edit&#039; next to Custom robots.txt and check the &#039;Yes&#039; check box. &lt;br /&gt;4. Paste your code or make changes as per your needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Once you are done, press Save Changes button.&lt;br /&gt;6. And congratulations, you are done!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How to see if changes are being made to Robots.txt?&lt;/h3&gt;As explained above, simply type your blog address in the url bar of your browser and add &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;/robots.txt&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; at the end of your url as you can see in this example below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;http://helplogger.blogspot.com&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: yellow;&quot;&gt;/robots.txt&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Once you visit the robots.txt file, you will see the code which you are using in your custom robots.txt file. See the below screenshot:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Final Words:&lt;/h3&gt;Are we through then bloggers?

In some occasions, you don&#039;t want people to  when they surf to posts or pages that don&#039;t exist on your blog and instead, make all requests to a specific link to be redirected to another page. One of the best way to avoid broken links and keep your traffic flowing in the right direction is setting custom redirects via the&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;Blogger Custom Redirects&lt;/b&gt; tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;ssmainhide&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;ssmainhide&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;In this post, we will see how to set custom redirects for Blogger posts and redirect an old URL to a new URL. But before redirecting any URL, you must know that there are two types of redirects:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;302 redirect&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; means that the page &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;has moved temporarily&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;. This redirect doesn&#039;t pass the URL value to the new location and instead, it will take the visitors to an appropriate location so that you aren&#039;t showing them a 404 page not found, or an error page. You can use a 302 redirect for coming soon pages or maintenance pages. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;301 redirect&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; means that a page &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;has moved permanently&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; to a new location. Use the 301 redirect when you deleted or changed the URL of your post. In most instances, the 301 redirects are always recommended for SEO because they will pass link juice (ranking power) to the redirected page and visitors will also benefit from this. However, 301s aren&#039;t suitable when you change your custom-domain, because it only supports redirection within the same blog, not to an external URL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that we&#039;ve established which is which, let&#039;s see how to set custom redirects for Blogger posts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How to redirect old URL to new URL in Blogger&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #3d85c6;&quot;&gt;Step 1.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Login to you Blogger account with email and password.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #3d85c6;&quot;&gt;Step 2.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Click on your blog &amp;gt; go to Settings \\ Search Preferences and click &quot;Edit&quot; next to &quot;Custom Redirects.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #3d85c6;&quot;&gt;Step 3.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Enter the old URL in the &quot;From&quot; field, and the new URL in the &quot;To&quot; field including the forward slash &quot;/&quot; (see the screenshot below)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note: Do not enter the full URL in these fields.

This way, Blogger users will be able to use Google+ as a commenting system for their blogs, while comments from Google+ will automatically appear on their blogs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;ssmainhide&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who haven&#039;t yet upgraded the Blogger profile to a Google+ profile, here&#039;s a tutorial on . Once you have connected a blog to a Google+ profile, you&#039;ll have a new &quot;&lt;b&gt;Use Google+ Comments on this blog&lt;/b&gt;&quot; setting on the Google+ tab of your blog. To enable the Google plus commenting system, just check the box next to this setting:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as you&#039;ve enabled the feature through your Blogger Dashboard, you&#039;ll have the following features:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- &lt;b&gt;Threaded commenting system&lt;/b&gt;: the threaded system will allow a reader to reply to other comments on that post, thus the conversations will become much easier, more effective and more enjoyable&lt;br /&gt;- &lt;b&gt;Public and private comments&lt;/b&gt;: this ensures a better privacy for your visitors which can make their comments either public or private&lt;br /&gt;- &lt;b&gt;Edit or delete comments&lt;/b&gt;: your visitors will be able to edit any comments that they wrote even after publishing, so they don&#039;t have to write another comment  explaining the correction&lt;br /&gt;- &lt;b&gt;Google Plus One (+1) button in comments&lt;/b&gt;: we can up-vote any comment by clicking this button. This is a great feature which could also help you to get some traffic from Google+&lt;br /&gt;- &lt;b&gt;&quot;Also share on Google+&quot; check box&lt;/b&gt;: with this option which is right below the comment editor, we will be able to share a specific comment on Google+ and thus get more traffic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Things to consider before adding the Google Plus Comments in Blogger:&lt;/h3&gt;- the Google Plus commenting system won&#039;t work for private and adult blogs&lt;br /&gt;- If you are using a third-party commenting system like Disqus, your comments might not be retained when you enable Google+ Comments&lt;br /&gt;- If you change domain name, comments will be gone. Therefore, it would be highly recommended to implement the Google Plus commenting system only after you&#039;ve decided to use a custom domain name &lt;br /&gt;- If you choose to allow comments pending moderation, you will have to visit the post in order to  approve, hide or delete comments before they are publicly visible&lt;br /&gt;- Only registered Google+ users can comment, this means that visitors who don&#039;t have a Google+ account will not be able to comment on your blog&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to Enable Google Plus on Custom Blogger Templates&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are using a custom blogger template, the comments might not show up after checking the &quot;&lt;b&gt;Use Google+ Comments on this blog&lt;/b&gt;&quot; setting. In this case, we will need to apply the following trick in order to enable it on custom templates:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #3d85c6;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 1. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;From the , go to &lt;b&gt;Template&lt;/b&gt; and click on the &lt;b&gt;Edit HTML&lt;/b&gt; button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #3d85c6;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 2.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Click anywhere inside the code area and press the Ctrl + F keys to open the Blogger search box.&lt;br /&gt;Type or paste the following line inside the search box and hit Enter to find it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div class=&#039;post-footer&#039;&amp;gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #3d85c6;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 3.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Just below it, paste this code:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div class=&#039;cmt_iframe_holder&#039; data-viewtype=&#039;FILTERED_POSTMOD&#039; expr:href=&#039;data:blog.canonicalUrl&#039;/&amp;gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #3d85c6;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 4.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Click on the &lt;b&gt;Save template&lt;/b&gt; button to save the changes... and that&#039;s it. Now we should be able to enjoy the Google Plus comments in our Blogspot blogs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy commenting!', 'admin', 'post', 3, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '1'),

Let&#039;s take a look at what it could look like in this .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a wallpaper or photo blog that would benefit from displaying a thumbnail grid style layout, look no further. Here&#039;s how you can add Grid (gallery) View to Blogger posts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Adding Grid (Gallery) View to Blogger Posts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #3d85c6;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 1.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #3d85c6;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 2.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Click anywhere inside the code area and press the CTRL + F keys to open the search box&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;

inside the search box and hit Enter to find it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #3d85c6;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 4.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Just above the &lt;span style=&quot;background-color: yellow;&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

Once the number of total posts in our blog exceeds this number, we will see &quot;Older Posts&quot; and &quot;Newer Posts&quot; navigation links in our home page and archive pages footer as Blogger doesn&#039;t have any built-in function on page numbering. But page numbers instead of older and newer posts links could help our blog visitors to navigate quicker (jump from one page to another page or click on a specific page) and know the total number of posts published. Here&#039;s a tutorial on how to add numbered page navigation using Javascript to a Blogger/ blogspot blog. You can select any one of the 7 different styles that I have mentioned below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Adding Numbered Page Navigation to Blogger&lt;/h2&gt;You can add this widget in just two steps.&lt;br /&gt;1. Adding The CSS.&lt;br /&gt;2. Adding The Script.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now let&#039;s see how to add the CSS style for page navigation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1.

For it, you don&#039;t need to be an SEO expert  but you need to know the minimum so that your posts are well indexed in the search engines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The phrase &quot;content is king&quot; is one of the widest spread Internet memes being used by so many bloggers, with the idea that you should focus on having quality content, while the rest don&#039;t matter much. This is not true. Quality content is important, but it shouldn&#039;t be the only concern of a blogger today. In addition to producing quality content, your text needs to be optimized for the search engines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;tr-caption-container&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;tr-caption&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Boost traffic &amp;amp; increase SERP visibility with SEO &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5 easy ways to improve the SEO of a blog&lt;/h2&gt;Now, let&#039;s see what would be the basics that any blogger needs to learn about SEO and other simple SEO knowledge. Below are 5 easy tips to improve the SEO of your blog:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. Define the keyword&lt;/h3&gt;When you write a post, it is recommended to choose the keyword (or term) suitable for your text. What you want is that this keyword - or term - to be searched on Google, and then get your post among the top. For this, you need to use this keyword a few times in the text.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example, here the keyword could be SEO, but this term is too generic and I could hardly get in the top for this search. Then I&#039;ll work with a phrase or a long tail keyword, so that this post will rank for the term &quot;&lt;strong&gt;easy ways to improve the SEO of a blog&lt;/strong&gt;&quot;. I will use this phrase a few times, but without overdoing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. Use the keyword in the post title &lt;/h3&gt;Now that I have defined the keyword, I will use it in the post title. This step is very important, and certainly will help you to get a better rank in search engines. As you can see, what I have in the title is the &lt;strong&gt;easy ways to improve the SEO of a blog&lt;/strong&gt; keyword, along with other words to form an attractive and optimized title for SEO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. Use the keyword in the H2 tags&lt;/h3&gt;You must also use heading tags (h2, h3) in your posts. Here, I am using the keyword &quot;&lt;strong&gt;easy ways to improve the SEO of a blog&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; in a H2 heading. Do this always, because it also helps to become well positioned in the search results. If you don&#039;t know or don&#039;t understand what are the heading tags, I would suggest to do a further research on this subject.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4. Use the keyword in the text&lt;/h3&gt;Make use of your chosen keywords throughout the text. Especially in the first paragraph (please note that I have repeated the title in italics in the first sentence). But be careful when doing this, there is a maximum and minimum limit for that. A good keyword density is between 1.5% to 4.5% for best results. Less than that will have no effect and more than that can alert the search engines and your text might be considered spam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;5. Publish Posts with 300 words or more&lt;/h3&gt;Posts under 300 words have little chance to be among the top results in search engines. Of course, you will be able to rank for multiple keywords that are less popular with less than 300 words, but for the most competitive keywords that have the potential to bring a greater number of visits, it will be nearly impossible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus, it is recommended to write posts with more than 300 words. It&#039;s not hard when you really understand the topic you&#039;re talking about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;As you can see, with some simple SEO techniques you can improve the traffic coming to your blog from the search engines.

The margin is the space between the edge of the sheet of paper and the other elements (the parts of the frame) and the padding would be the space between the edge of the sheet and where the type starts on the page. The border would be the edge of the sheet of paper. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#039;s probably easier to understand if you have borders, then it also becomes obvious which one to use. Do you want the &quot;space&quot; after the border (outside the element = margin) or before the border (inside the element = padding). ', 'admin', 'post', 3, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '1'),

This may happen, for example, when we visit a page where we have to login with an username and a password. In this case, after verifying that the login is correct, usually a cookie is recorded on our computer. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An example would be the popular page of Google. This search engine allows users to choose how many search results they want to see on each page. Thanks to a cookie, this configuration remains unchanged for each computer, even after rebooting several sessions. Despite this, it is good to remove them from time to time because, although, some will expire being erased automatically  after a while, some of them will never do so. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;ssmainhide&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like many other things, cookies may suffer a poor use and hence their bad reputation. For instance, some websites can store and study the browsing habits of a user without their knowledge. This is why most browsers already include a system to filter them and can decide if they will provide some privacy or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to see a live example of how a cookie works, please visit  and refresh it a few times. You should get an alert window telling you about how many times you visited the page.&lt;br /&gt;(script source: )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There could be other ways to use cookies but a server could do this with JavaScript. Below we have a simple script that can be used as many times we want, even for different purposes. Basically, what the following script does is to create three functions: the first one is to set a cookie, the second one is to read it, and the last one is to erase it. We can apply it in Blogger by accessing the template HTML and add it just before the &lt;b&gt;&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;&lt;/b&gt; tag:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;script type=&#039;text/javascript&#039;&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;//&amp;lt;![CDATA[&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #cc0000;&quot;&gt;// Set cookie&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;function setCookie(name, value, expires, path, domain, secure) {&lt;br /&gt;document.cookie = name + &quot;=&quot; + escape(value) +&lt;br /&gt;((expires == null) ? &quot;&quot; : &quot;; expires=&quot; + expires.toGMTString()) +&lt;br /&gt;((path == null) ? &quot;&quot; : &quot;; path=&quot; + path) +&lt;br /&gt;((domain == null) ? &quot;&quot; : &quot;; domain=&quot; + domain) +&lt;br /&gt;((secure == null) ? &quot;&quot; : &quot;; secure&quot;);&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #cc0000;&quot;&gt;// Read cookie&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;function getCookie(name){&lt;br /&gt;var cname = name + &quot;=&quot;;&lt;br /&gt;var dc = document.cookie;&lt;br /&gt;if (dc.length &amp;gt; 0) {&lt;br /&gt;begin = dc.indexOf(cname);&lt;br /&gt;if (begin != -1) {&lt;br /&gt;begin += cname.length;&lt;br /&gt;end = dc.indexOf(&quot;;&quot;, begin);&lt;br /&gt;if (end == -1) end = dc.length;&lt;br /&gt;return unescape(dc.substring(begin, end));&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;br /&gt;return null;&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #cc0000;&quot;&gt;//delete cookie&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;function eraseCookie (name,path,domain) {&lt;br /&gt;if (getCookie(name)) {&lt;br /&gt;document.cookie = name + &quot;=&quot; +&lt;br /&gt;((path == null) ? &quot;&quot; : &quot;; path=&quot; + path) +&lt;br /&gt;((domain == null) ? &quot;&quot; : &quot;; domain=&quot; + domain) +&lt;br /&gt;&quot;; expires=Thu, 01-Jan-70 00:00:01 GMT&quot;;&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;//]]&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Once done, in order to set a cookie, we only need to put the name and the value in quotes when we call the function. Additionally, we will set the expiry date by getting the current Time (in milliseconds) and add the required number of minutes (in milliseconds):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;var expiration = new Date();&lt;br /&gt;expiration.setTime(expiration.getTime() + &lt;b&gt;10000&lt;/b&gt;); &lt;span style=&quot;color: #cc0000;&quot;&gt;//Expire after 10 seconds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;setCookie(&quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #3d85c6;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;cookiename&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&quot;,&quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #0b5394;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;hello&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&quot;,expiration);&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;/blockquote&gt;The above code sets a cookie called &lt;span style=&quot;color: #3d85c6;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;cookiename&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, with the &lt;span style=&quot;color: #0b5394;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;hello&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; value and set its expiry date to 10 seconds after it has been set (&lt;b&gt;10000&lt;/b&gt; milliseconds = 10 seconds). If we want to restore the value of this cookie, then we should use the second function with the cookie name:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;var checkCookie = getCookie(&quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #3d85c6;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;cookiename&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&quot;);&lt;/blockquote&gt;By adding this code below &lt;b&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/b&gt;, we created a cookie with the value &#039;&lt;b&gt;hello&lt;/b&gt;&#039; which can be shown on the screen if we want to. The cookie will disappear after 10 seconds:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;script type=&#039;text/javascript&#039;&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;var expiration = new Date();&lt;br /&gt;expiration.setTime(expiration.getTime() + &lt;b&gt;10000&lt;/b&gt;);&lt;br /&gt;setCookie(&quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #3d85c6;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;cookiename&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&quot;,&quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #0b5394;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;hello&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&quot;,expiration);&lt;br /&gt;var checkCookie = getCookie(&quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #3d85c6;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;cookiename&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&quot;);&lt;br /&gt;document.write(checkCookie);&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The erase function is used in the same way as the one for reading just by clicking on the name of the cookie. The &lt;b&gt;setCookie&lt;/b&gt; values for &#039;domain&#039; and &#039;secure&#039; are not utilized.

So, I decided to make this quick tutorial to show you another way of adding the CSS without having to access the Blogger HTML editor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;ssmainhide&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #3d85c6;&quot;&gt;Adding CSS via the Blogger Template Designer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #3d85c6;&quot;&gt;Step 1.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Log in to your  and select the blog that you want to customize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #3d85c6;&quot;&gt;Step 2.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; From the Blogger dashboard, choose &quot;&lt;b&gt;Template&lt;/b&gt;&quot; and click on the &quot;&lt;b&gt;Customize&lt;/b&gt;&quot; button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #3d85c6;&quot;&gt;Step 3.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Click on the &quot;&lt;b&gt;Advanced&lt;/b&gt;&quot; tab.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #3d85c6;&quot;&gt;Step 4.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Now just add your CSS code inside the right field, located in the &quot;&lt;b&gt;Add CSS&lt;/b&gt;&quot; tab (if you have more options, you may need to scroll down the list). Here you can add any CSS code when you want to apply a new style to your template.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #3d85c6;&quot;&gt;Step 5. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Once added, click on the &quot;&lt;b&gt;Apply to blog&lt;/b&gt;&quot; button to save the changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following this method you can&#039;t edit the existing CSS styles already added in your template, which will require to access the template&#039;s HTML and make the modifications there. Here you can only add new styles and edit the existing styles added through the Template Designer panel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also important to mention that when adding the CSS styles, it isn&#039;t required to put the &lt;b&gt;&amp;lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/b&gt; ... &lt;b&gt;&amp;lt;/style&amp;gt;&lt;/b&gt; style tags, which normally  would go above the &lt;b&gt;&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;&lt;/b&gt; tag of the template html. Adding those tags may result in an error.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you change the template, the CSS added here will be removed. The same goes for any other additions or CSS customizations made â€‹â€‹through the Template HTML editor.', 'admin', 'post', 3, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '1');

As for the gadgets, usually it is required to access the blog&#039;s layout in order to add or arrange any of the page elements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a better understanding, here are some basic explanations about the &lt;b&gt;Page Elements&lt;/b&gt; located in the &lt;b&gt;Layout&lt;/b&gt; section of a &lt;b&gt;Blogger dashboard&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What are the Page Elements?&lt;/h3&gt;Page Elements is, basically, the body of our blog.

The sections mark certain &lt;b&gt;areas of a page&lt;/b&gt;. Every section is represented by the tag &lt;span style=&quot;background-color: yellow;&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b:section&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; and has an unique &quot;ID&quot; that names its element which is followed by a &quot;&lt;b&gt;class&lt;/b&gt;&quot; tag. Each section has some &lt;b&gt;attributes&lt;/b&gt; and through these, we can determine &lt;b&gt;the number of elements&lt;/b&gt; allowed in the section and if this section gives the &lt;b&gt;option to add a &quot;page element&quot;&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#039;s take a look to an example of the default code related to the &lt;b&gt;header&lt;/b&gt; section found in the HTML of a Blogger template:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: yellow;&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b:section&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #6aa84f;&quot;&gt;class=&#039;header&#039;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #cc0000;&quot;&gt;id=&#039;header&#039;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #674ea7;&quot;&gt;maxwidgets=&#039;1&#039;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #3d85c6;&quot;&gt;showaddelement=&#039;no&#039;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #999999;&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;-- rest of the code --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;/b:section&amp;gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Breaking apart the code above:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: yellow;&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b:section&lt;/span&gt; is the opening tag of the section.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #6aa84f;&quot;&gt;class=&#039;header&#039;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; - describes the existing group inside the &quot;header&quot; element &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #cc0000;&quot;&gt;id=&#039;header&#039;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; - identifies and specifies the header as a single element.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #674ea7;&quot;&gt;maxwidgets=&#039;1&#039;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; - determines the number of elements allowed in the &quot;&lt;b&gt;header&lt;/b&gt;&quot;; here we have the number of gadgets that we can include in the header section. In this example, &lt;span style=&quot;color: #674ea7;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&#039;1&#039;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; means that this section allows us to add only a gadget.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #3d85c6;&quot;&gt;showaddelement=&#039;no&#039;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; - the &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #3d85c6;&quot;&gt;&#039;no&#039;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; attribute means that the header will not show the &quot;&lt;b&gt;Add a gadget&lt;/b&gt;&quot; link or we won&#039;t be able to move any Page Elements. To activate this option so that we can add new Page Elements (Add a gadget), we should change&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #3d85c6;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&#039;no&#039;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to &lt;span style=&quot;color: #3d85c6;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&#039;yes&#039;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. By setting the &quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #3d85c6;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;showaddelement&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&quot; attribute to &lt;span style=&quot;color: #3d85c6;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&#039;yes&#039;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, we&#039;ll be able to arrange the elements as we like, just click on the element that you want to move and drag &amp;amp; drop it wherever you want.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;The spaces reserved for adding elements in the existing sections are called &lt;b&gt;Gadgets&lt;/b&gt; (or Widgets). You can easily add various Page Elements by clicking &quot;&lt;b&gt;Add a Gadget&lt;/b&gt;&quot; link. This will open a pop-up window for you to pick and choose which elements should be added. Click on the Gadget&#039;s title or on the blue plus sign symbol to add it to your blog&#039;s layout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After you have added a page element, gadgets can be moved up, down or sideways. You can put them wherever you want. Of all the existing gadgets, the most used is the &quot;&lt;b&gt;HTML/JavaScript&lt;/b&gt;&quot;. Inside this gadget (widget) you can insert any code, as long as it is in the HTML or JavaScript language.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each time you decide to add a new gadget, click on the &quot;Add a gadget&quot; link in the area where you want to add it. For example, if you want to add a &lt;b&gt;JavaScript code&lt;/b&gt; and want it to appear &lt;b&gt;in the sidebar&lt;/b&gt;, you should click on the &quot;&lt;b&gt;Add a gadget&lt;/b&gt;&quot; in the &quot;sidebar&quot; section, choose the &quot;&lt;b&gt;HTML/JavaScript&lt;/b&gt;&quot; option and paste the code in there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you have added new gadgets (widgets), it is recommended to check the changes by clicking on the &lt;b&gt;Preview&lt;/b&gt; button before saving anything. So, if something went wrong, you simply click on &quot;&lt;b&gt;Clear&lt;/b&gt;&quot; so that everything that was not saved to return to its previous state. If the position of any Page Elements (Gadgets) has been rearranged, you will need to click on the &lt;b&gt;Save arrangement&lt;/b&gt; button in order to see the changes.', 'admin', 'post', 3, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '1'),

with the titles that you want to appear. To change the social media icons, add the links of your icons instead of the ones &lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;in blue&lt;/span&gt;. If you don&#039;t know how to upload and get the URL of an image, please read . &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to remove the sub categories, remove the code within the tags highlighted in yellow, including the &lt;span style=&quot;background-color: yellow;&quot;&gt;ul&lt;/span&gt; tags. To remove only a menu element, remove the part that starts with &amp;lt;li&amp;gt; and ends with &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #3d85c6;&quot;&gt;Step 4. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;And now let&#039;s add the CSS styling for the menu. Search for the following piece of code:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;]]&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/b:skin&amp;gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Just above &lt;span style=&quot;background-color: yellow;&quot;&gt;]]&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/b:skin&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; add this code: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;#contact-links {&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; text-shadow: 0 -1px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

What about this cool effect that consists in gradual transition from one style to another, as you can see in this demo below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;example7&quot;&gt;Hover Over Me!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;style&gt;#example7 { padding: 15px; background-color: #FF7CA6; font-size: 16px; width: 30%; font-weight: bold; color: #fff; height: 20px; -moz-transition-property: background-color,width,height,padding,font-size,color,border-radius; -moz-transition-duration: 1s; -webkit-transition-property: background-color,width,height,padding,font-size,color,border-radius; -webkit-transition-duration: 1s; -o-transition-property: background-color,width,height,padding,font-size,color,border-radius; -o-transition-duration: 1s; } #example7:hover { background-color:#9c3; width: 30%; height: 140px; padding: 80px 30px 0px; font-size: 20px; color: #FFFF00; -webkit-border-radius: 100px;  -moz-border-radius: 100px;  border-radius: 100px;  -moz-transition-property: background-color,width,height,padding,font-size,color, border-radius; -moz-transition-duration: 2s; -webkit-transition-property: background-color,width,height,padding,font-size,color,border-radius; -webkit-transition-duration: 2s; -o-transition-property: background-color,width,height,padding,font-size,color,border-radius; -o-transition-duration: 2s; } &lt;/style&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This transition is achieved by using the CSS3 transition property - property which is supported in all major browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Safari (for Safari we will need the -webkit- prefix to get this effect).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;ssmainhide&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #3d85c6;&quot;&gt;The CSS3 Transition Syntax&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;The syntax of the transition supports four values:&lt;br /&gt;- the property affected by the transition, such as color, border, background, width, etc.&lt;br /&gt;- the duration of this transition in seconds, i.e., how long it will take to change your style completely&lt;br /&gt;- the delay time for the transition to be executed, also in seconds, i.e., how long it takes for the transition to start when the mouse hovers over that element;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out the code below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;.example {&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;transition-property: width; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #6aa84f;&quot;&gt;/* property that undergoes a transition */&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;transition-duration: 2s; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #6aa84f;&quot;&gt;/* duration of the transition */&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;transition-timing-function: linear;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #6aa84f;&quot;&gt; /* timing-function */&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;transition-delay: 0; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #6aa84f;&quot;&gt;/* length of time to delay the start of a transition */ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #6aa84f;&quot;&gt;/* now we will repeat the entire declaration with the -webkit- prefix for the effect to work in Chrome and Safari */&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;-webkit-transition-property: width;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;-webkit-transition-duration: 2s;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;-webkit-transition-timing-function: linear;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;-webkit-transition-delay: 0;&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;/blockquote&gt;In the example above, the elements with the class .&lt;b&gt;example&lt;/b&gt; will become wide within two seconds as the mouse passes over them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When we define the style of a link, usually we need to use the &lt;b&gt;a:link&lt;/b&gt; selector, and when defining the style when the mouse is over the link, we need to use the &lt;b&gt;:hover&lt;/b&gt; selector. However, the transition can be used in any HTML element, not just links.  &lt;!-- adsense --&gt;To make the transition effect to work properly, we should define two blocks of style for that element, i.e. the normal style for a tag/id/class and the style on mouse &lt;b&gt;:hover&lt;/b&gt; for a specific tag/id/class. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;tag, #id, .class {&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #6aa84f;&quot;&gt;/* insert here the styles that you want for the selector */&lt;br /&gt;/* insert below the transition effects */&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;br /&gt;tag&lt;b&gt;:hover&lt;/b&gt;, #id&lt;b&gt;:hover&lt;/b&gt;, class&lt;b&gt;:hover&lt;/b&gt; {&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #6aa84f;&quot;&gt;/* Insert here the styles for when the mouse is over the element */&lt;br /&gt;/* here it is not necessary to repeat the declaration of the transition */&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;/blockquote&gt;You can add the same style on multiple selectors separated by commas as I have done above, although that&#039;s not necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Below are some transition examples with their respective codes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not use the &lt;b&gt;transition-timing-function&lt;/b&gt; in these examples because it makes no difference, as the first value is the duration in seconds and the second is the delay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #3d85c6;&quot;&gt;Example 1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;example1&quot;&gt;Transition example&lt;/div&gt;&lt;style&gt;#example1 {  background: #FFFF00;

} #example1:hover { background: #B5E2FF; } &lt;/style&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #6aa84f;&quot;&gt;/* with a single property */&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#example1 {&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #cc0000;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;background-color: #FFFF00;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-moz-transition-property: &lt;span style=&quot;color: #cc0000;&quot;&gt;background-color&lt;/span&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;-moz-transition-duration: 2s;&lt;br /&gt;-webkit-transition-property: &lt;span style=&quot;color: #cc0000;&quot;&gt;background-color&lt;/span&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;-webkit-transition-duration: 2s;&lt;br /&gt;-o-transition-property: &lt;span style=&quot;color: #cc0000;&quot;&gt;background-color&lt;/span&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;-o-transition-duration: 2s;&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;br /&gt;#example1:hover {&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #cc0000;&quot;&gt;background-color: #B5E2FF;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #3d85c6;&quot;&gt;Example 2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;example2&quot;&gt;Transition example&lt;/div&gt;&lt;style&gt;#example2 { background: #9c3;

In Blogger, the CSS is located before &lt;span style=&quot;background-color: yellow;&quot;&gt;]]&amp;lt;/b:skin&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- as you can see in the examples above, you can assign different rules for the transitions of different elements in a single rule - just separate them with commas.&lt;br /&gt;- it is not mandatory to use the four properties in the transition declaration, but their order must always look like this: property/duration/timing-function/delay.&lt;br /&gt;- the duration and delay values â€‹â€‹must be expressed in seconds, but sometimes a second is a long time for a transition. In this case you can use values with milliseconds, for example, .5s means half a second.&lt;br /&gt;- In small time intervals, the timing of the transition-function property does not give a remarkable effect being most useful only in more advanced animations. The possible values are either &lt;b&gt;ease&lt;/b&gt; (the default, which makes the transition with a slow beginning, then gets faster and ends slowly),&lt;b&gt; linear&lt;/b&gt; (the same transition speed from beginning to end), &lt;b&gt;ease-in&lt;/b&gt; (transition begins slowly and then the speed increases), &lt;b&gt;ease-out &lt;/b&gt;(transition starts fast and slows down at the end) and &lt;b&gt;ease-in-out&lt;/b&gt;.', 'admin', 'post', 3, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '1'),
