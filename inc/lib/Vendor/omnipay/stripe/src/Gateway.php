/**
 * Stripe Gateway.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * <code>
 *   // Create a gateway for the Stripe Gateway
 *   // (routes to GatewayFactory::create)
 *   $gateway = Omnipay::create('Stripe');
 *
 *   // Initialise the gateway
 *   $gateway->initialize(array(
 *       'apiKey' => 'MyApiKey',
 *   ));
 *
 *   // Create a credit card object
 *   // This card can be used for testing.
 *   $card = new CreditCard(array(
 *               'firstName'    => 'Example',
 *               'lastName'     => 'Customer',
 *               'number'       => '4242424242424242',
 *               'expiryMonth'  => '01',
 *               'expiryYear'   => '2020',
 *               'cvv'          => '123',
 *               'email'                 => 'customer@example.com',
 *               'billingAddress1'       => '1 Scrubby Creek Road',
 *               'billingCountry'        => 'AU',
 *               'billingCity'           => 'Scrubby Creek',
 *               'billingPostcode'       => '4999',
 *               'billingState'          => 'QLD',
 *   ));
 *
 *   // Do a purchase transaction on the gateway
 *   $transaction = $gateway->purchase(array(
 *       'amount'                   => '10.00',
 *       'currency'                 => 'USD',
 *       'card'                     => $card,
 *   ));
 *   $response = $transaction->send();
 *   if ($response->isSuccessful()) {
 *       echo "Purchase transaction was successful!\n";

 *       echo "Transaction reference = " . $sale_id . "\n";
 *
 *       $balance_transaction_id = $response->getBalanceTransactionReference();
 *       echo "Balance Transaction reference = " . $balance_transaction_id . "\n";
 *   }
 * </code>
 *
 * Test modes:
 *
 * Stripe accounts have test-mode API keys as well as live-mode
 * API keys. These keys can be active at the same time. Data
 * created with test-mode credentials will never hit the credit
 * card networks and will never cost anyone money.
 *
 * Unlike some gateways, there is no test mode endpoint separate
 * to the live mode endpoint, the Stripe API endpoint is the same
 * for test and for live.
 *
 * Setting the testMode flag on this gateway has no effect.  To
 * use test mode just use your test mode API key.
 *
 * You can use any of the cards listed at https://stripe.com/docs/testing
 * for testing.
 *
 * Authentication:
 *
 * Authentication is by means of a single secret API key set as
 * the apiKey parameter when creating the gateway object.
 *
