/**
 * Stripe Fetch Token Request.
 *
 * Often you want to be able to charge credit cards or send payments
 * to bank accounts without having to hold sensitive card information
 * on your own servers. Stripe.js makes this easy in the browser, but
 * you can use the same technique in other environments with our token API.
 *
 * Tokens can be created with your publishable API key, which can safely
 * be embedded in downloadable applications like iPhone and Android apps.
 * You can then use a token anywhere in our API that a card or bank account
 * is accepted. Note that tokens are not meant to be stored or used more
 * than onceâ€”to store these details for use later, you should create
 * Customer or Recipient objects.
