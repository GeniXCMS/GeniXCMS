[Omnipay](https://github.com/thephpleague/omnipay) is a framework agnostic, multi-gateway payment
processing library for PHP 5.3+. This package implements Stripe support for Omnipay.

## Installation

Omnipay is installed via [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/). To install, simply add it
to your `composer.json` file:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "omnipay/stripe": "~2.0"
    }
}
```

And run composer to update your dependencies:

    $ curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php
    $ php composer.phar update

## Basic Usage

The following gateways are provided by this package:

* [Stripe](https://stripe.com/)

For general usage instructions, please see the main [Omnipay](https://github.com/thephpleague/omnipay)
repository.

### Stripe.js

The Stripe integration is fairly straight forward. Essentially you just pass
a `token` field through to Stripe instead of the regular credit card data.

Start by following the standard Stripe JS guide here:
[https://stripe.com/docs/tutorials/forms](https://stripe.com/docs/tutorials/forms)

After that you will have a `stripeToken` field which will be submitted to your server.
Simply pass this through to the gateway as `token`, instead of the usual `card` array:

```php
$token = $_POST['stripeToken'];
$response = $gateway->purchase(['amount' => '10.00', 'currency' => 'USD', 'token' => $token])->send();
```

### Stripe Connect

Stripe connect applications can charge an additional fee on top of Stripe's fees for charges they make on behalf of 
their users. To do this you need to specify an additional `transactionFee` parameter as part of an authorize or purchase
request.

When a charge is refunded the transaction fee is refunded with an amount proportional to the amount of the charge
refunded and by default this will come from your connected user's Stripe account effectively leaving them out of pocket.
To refund from your (the applications) Stripe account instead you can pass a ``refundApplicationFee`` parameter with a
boolean value of true as part of a refund request.

Note: making requests with Stripe Connect specific parameters can only be made using the OAuth access token you received
as part of the authorization process. Read more on Stripe Connect [here](https://stripe.com/docs/connect).

## Test Mode

Stripe accounts have test-mode API keys as well as live-mode API keys. These keys can be active
at the same time. Data created with test-mode credentials will never hit the credit card networks
and will never cost anyone money.

Unlike some gateways, there is no test mode endpoint separate to the live mode endpoint, the
Stripe API endpoint is the same for test and for live.
